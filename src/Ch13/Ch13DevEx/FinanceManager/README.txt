This is a personal finance manager program that maintains information on
your bank accounts. It incorporates the following rules:
- For savings accounts, you can make a maximum of three withdrawals in a month
  without incurring a fee. The bank charges $1.00 for every withdrawal after the third.
- For checking accounts, the bank charges $0.50 for every check you write for
  the first 20 checks (i.e., withdrawals) in a month. After that, there will be no charge.
You can open and save account information to a file. You can also list all transactions
of a given account or of all accounts. The program includes appropriate menus
to select the supported options.
This program may use the Date class from the java.util package to record
the date of transactions. Refer to a java.util reference manual for information
on this class.
